# Cookie-Sales-Dashboard

**Data Overview:**

The dataset contains three tables: 

1. **Cookie Types**: Contains details about each cookie type, including cost, revenue per cookie, and units sold.
2. **Orders**: Tracks customer orders, including order details, product information, and revenue.
3. **Customers**: Contains customer demographic data, such as location and contact information.

The customers here refer to the B2B customers. 

**Objective :** 

To analyze cookie sales data in Excel to gain insights into product performance, customer behavior (supermarkets and convenience stores), and regional sales trends. The goal is to identify top-performing cookies, high-value customers, revenue drivers, and cost efficiency using Excel's functions, pivot tables, and data visualization tools.

Before doing the analysis, all the tables have been joined based on their foreign key using VLOOKUP function.

     Using a pivot table, the total sales (sum of revenue) were calculated. The cookie type that generates the highest sales was identified using the **INDEX** and **MATCH** functions. The analysis shows that the **Chocolate Chip Cookie** generated the highest total revenue with more than $1,000,000

        Similarly, using profit calculations in a pivot table, it was observed that the **Chocolate Chip Cookie** also generated the highest profit.
        
        **Recommendation**: Focus on promoting Chocolate Chip Cookies further as a flagship product in campaigns and consider expanding the range (e.g., adding variations like double chocolate or limited-edition flavors).
